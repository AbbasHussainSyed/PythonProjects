# Text-to-Speech from Word Document

This Python script reads a Word document and converts its text content into an audio file using Google Text-to-Speech (
gTTS).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Install required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install docx2txt gtts

Usage:
Replace doc_path with the actual path to your Word document in the code.

Run the script:

python DocAudio.py

The script will print the text content and save it as an audio file named 'story.mp3'.

The audio file will be played using the default system player.

Additional Notes:
Ensure your Word document is in the correct path.
Adjust the code based on your specific needs.
Feel free to customize this README based on the specific details of your code and project. Provide more information
about the purpose of the script, any dependencies, and how users can interact with it.
