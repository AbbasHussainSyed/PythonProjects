# Car Data Analysis for Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to perform data analysis on a dataset containing information about various cars, with the goal of predicting car prices based on different features. The analysis involves exploring the relationships between car prices and factors such as brand, model, and other relevant attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [provide dataset source]. It includes the following columns:

- **Brand:** The brand or manufacturer of the car.
- **Model:** The model name of the car.
- **Year:** The manufacturing year of the car.
- **Mileage:** The total distance the car has traveled.
- **Fuel Type:** The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel).
- **Transmission:** The type of transmission (automatic, manual).
- **Engine Size:** The size of the car's engine in cubic centimeters (cc).
- **Horsepower:** The car's horsepower.
- **Price:** The target variable - the price of the car.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical representations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explore the distribution of car prices.
   - Analyze the relationships between price and different features (e.g., brand, model).

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance predictive modeling.

4. **Modeling:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Select and train a machine learning model for price prediction.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

5. **Fine-Tuning:**
   - Optimize the model parameters for better predictions.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the results of the analysis, including predicted vs. actual prices.
   - Create visual representations of feature importance.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the analysis:

- Python (version x.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-data-analysis.git
cd car-data-analysis
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook car_analysis.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook for step-by-step analysis and predictions.
